# Personal Site

Today I try to create my own website again for the 3<sup>rd</sup>(?) time.
The first time was back in 2018 when I was on summer break from University. I just came back from a 2 month trip from Glasgow and Germany and figured I wanted to do something useful. So I thought to myself what I lacked the most and the first thing that popped into me was web development. You can check out the About Me page for more details, but the tl;dr was that I was a games programming diploma holder back in Polytechnic and was currently doing a CS course in the University of Glasgow. In both Poly and Uni, I had zero experiences in web development. Well there kinda was one but I managed to wing my way through that by being a project lead.

That brings us to this 3rd attempt here, something I hope I will see it through by pushing deploying to the the domain, which I felt was coolaf, that I bought close to 3 months ago. This time I simplified it to just getting it by using `Gatsby` hopefully it works this time

### Technologies used

1. Gatsby
2. Graphql
